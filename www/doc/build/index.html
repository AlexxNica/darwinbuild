Building Darwin Projects

<h3>Overview</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
Building Darwin projects is almost certainly different than any other open source
projects you've built before.  
</p>
<p>
Most projects originating from Apple are built with
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">Xcode</a>.
On the other hand, most open source projects from other systems are built with 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a> or
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/makefile.html">BSD make</a>.
Projects of common origin are often built in a similar style to one another, 
and you may be used to the tight-knit build environment
provided by these systems.  For example, FreeBSD's
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html">make world</a>
is widely revered by open source enthusiasts.
</p>
<p>
Because Darwin draws from many different open source systems,
Apple wraps each of these projects with its own high-level makefile to give them an
interface consistent with Xcode.  Most of the behavior of these wrapper makefiles is defined by the
<a href="http://darwinsource.opendarwin.org/Current/CoreOSMakefiles/">CoreOSMakefiles</a> project
in Darwin.
</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<a name="command"></a><h3>Build Command</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
This document will refer to command line invocation used to build a Darwin project as the build command.
The tool that is invoked by the build command is the build tool.  Currently, all Darwin projects are built
with one of two build tools:
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html">xcodebuild</a>
and
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/make.1.html">make</a>.
</p>
<p><small><i>Note:</i> In Mac OS X 10.2 and later, make is GNU Make, and can also be invoked as gnumake.
The BSD make command is known as bsdmake.</small>
</p>
<p>
If the project contains an Xcode project (.xcodeproj, .xcode, .pbproj), then the xcodebuild 
tool should be used.  Otherwise, the
tool should be used.
</p>
<p>
In general, the arguments passed to the xcodebuild or make command will not differ.  The first argument should
be "install".  Unlike other projects which might require a "make all" before a "make install", Darwin projects
skip ahead to the install phase right away.  Because each project will attempt to set the correct user and group
ownership on the files it produces, it's always necessary to build Darwin projects as the root user.  After the
"install" argument, many additional argument are passed.  Each of these arguments is described in the
<a href="#roots">Roots</a> and
<a href="#environment">Environment Variables</a> sections below.
</p>
<p>Here is the build command that was used for xnu (the Darwin kernel) when compiling
Darwin 8.0.1, the release corresponding to Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger):</p>
<pre>
root# make install  \
	"SRCROOT=/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-792" \
	"OBJROOT=/private/var/tmp/xnu/xnu-792.obj~1" \
	"SYMROOT=/private/var/tmp/xnu/xnu-792.sym~1" \
	"DSTROOT=/private/var/tmp/xnu/xnu-792.root~1" \
	"RC_ProjectName=xnu" \
	"RC_ProjectSourceVersion=792" \
	"RC_ProjectNameAndSourceVersion=xnu-792" \
	"RC_ProjectBuildVersion=1" \
	"INSTALLED_PRODUCT_ASIDES=YES" \
	"MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4" \
	"NEXT_ROOT=" \
	"RC_ARCHS=ppc i386" \
	"RC_CFLAGS=-pipe -no-cpp-precomp -arch ppc -arch i386" \
	"RC_JASPER=YES" \
	"RC_NONARCH_CFLAGS=-pipe -no-cpp-precomp" \
	"RC_OS=macos" \
	"RC_RELEASE=Tiger" \
	"RC_XBS=YES" \
	"RC_i386=YES" \
	"RC_ppc=YES" \
	"SEPARATE_STRIP=YES" \
	"UNAME_RELEASE=8.0" \
	"UNAME_SYSNAME=Darwin"
</pre>

<div class="article">
<a name="roots"></a><h3>Roots</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
In this document, Roots refer to several different filesystem directories that are
used when building Darwin projects.  The Build Root is the directory that is the
filesystem root for the current build environment.  This will either be the actual
root directory (/) or another directory which contains a full build environment and
has been set to the root directory using 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/chroot.8.html">chroot</a>.
</p>
<p>
The first four arguments following "install" in the example build command above
specify the filesystem path of the four Roots: SRCROOT, OBJROOT, SYMROOT, and DSTROOT.
These Roots represent absolute paths to four different directories that will be used
while building the project.  SRCROOT gives the location of the sources to be built,
OBJROOT gives the location for intermediate files created during the build (.o's),
SYMROOT gives the location for debug symboled output files, and DSTROOT gives the
location for the finished product.  With the exception of SRCROOT, all of these directories
should be empty before the build begins, and should be owned by root:wheel.
</p>
<p>
After the build is complete, the OBJROOT is no longer needed and may be deleted.
In order to install the newly built project, the contents of the DSTROOT may be copied to 
the root filesystem (/).  Many, but not all, Darwin projects are compatible with a full 
Mac OS X system, so exercise caution and be prepared to undo your changes.
</p>
<p><small><b><i>Important note:</i></b> because Apple never uses paths with spaces during the build,
some Darwin projects may not build correctly if spaces are used in one of these paths.
This may lead to files being written to arbitrary locations on the disk, and could
lead to loss of data.  <i>Never use spaces in the Roots' paths.</i></small>
</p>
<p>When Apple builds Mac OS X, paths of the following form are used for the Roots:</p>
<pre>
	SRCROOT=/SourceCache/<i>project</i>/<i>project</i>-<i>version</i>
	OBJROOT=/private/var/tmp/<i>project</i>/<i>project</i>-<i>version</i>.obj~1
	SYMROOT=/private/var/tmp/<i>project</i>/<i>project</i>-<i>version</i>.sym~1
	DSTROOT=/private/var/tmp/<i>project</i>/<i>project</i>-<i>version</i>.root~1
</pre>
</div>
</div>



<div class="article">
<a name="environment"></a><h3>Environment Variables</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
Xcode and the CoreOSMakefiles determine much of their behavior based on the current
environment variables.  Each of the variables passed in the
<a href="#command">Build Command</a>
should also be set in the environment.  When Apple builds Mac OS X, many additional
environment variables are set.  Here are the variables which are set while building
projects found in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger):
</p>
<dl class="environ">

<dt>RC_ProjectName=<i>project</i></dt>
<dd>The name of the project being built.  For example, when building the Darwin kernel, this
should be "xnu".  This variable has special significance for projects that have
<a href="#aliases">build aliases</a>.</dd>

<dt>RC_ProjectSourceVersion=<i>version</i></dt>
<dd>The source code version of the project being built.  For example, when building the Darwin
kernel for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), this should be "792".</dd>

<dt>RC_ProjectNameAndSourceVersion=<i>project</i>-<i>version</i></dt>
<dd>The combination of $RC_ProjectName and $RC_ProjectSourceVersion separated by a hyphen.</dd>

<dt>RC_ProjectBuildVersion=<i>number</i></dt>
<dd>A number that may be used to distinguish multiple attempts to build the same project.</dd>

<dt>SRCROOT=/SourceCache/<i>project</i>/<i>project</i>-<i>version</i></dt>
<dd>Absolute path to the sources being built.</dd>

<dt>OBJROOT=/private/var/tmp/<i>project</i>/<i>project</i>-<i>version</i>.obj~<i>build_version</i></dt>
<dd>Absolute path to directory for intermediate files.</dd>

<dt>SYMROOT=/private/var/tmp/<i>project</i>/<i>project</i>-<i>version</i>.sym~<i>build_version</i></dt>
<dd>Absolute path to directory for debug symboled files.</dd>

<dt>DSTROOT=/private/var/tmp/<i>project</i>/<i>project</i>-<i>version</i>.root~<i>build_version</i></dt>
<dd>Absolute path to directory for finished product.</dd>

<dt>INSTALLED_PRODUCT_ASIDES=YES</dt>
<dd>By default Xcode will place build products directly into $DSTROOT.
Setting INSTALLED_PRODUCT_ASIDES to YES instructs Xcode to place build products
in $SYMROOT first, then copy them to $DSTROOT.  This allows the debug symboled
binary to be retained in $SYMROOT, while the binary $DSTROOT can be stripped
of debug symbols using
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/strip.1.html">strip</a>.
(INSTALLED_PRODUCT_ASIDES implies SEPARATE_STRIP to a certain degree.)</dd>

<dt>SEPARATE_STRIP=YES</dt>
<dd>Instructs Xcode to explicitly use the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/strip.1.html">strip</a>
command instead of the -s argument to the linker
(<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ld.1.html">ld</a>).
This is necessary because the linker is unable to strip some projects of their debug symbols successfully.

<!-- <a href="rdar://problem/4104343">4104343</a> -->
</dd>

<dt>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4</dt>
<dd>This Mac OS X version number is used by the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/cross_development/">Cross Development</a>
feature of Xcode, and indicates which version of the Mac OS you intend to run your finished product on.  The
AvailabilityMacros.h header file conditionally defines the Mac OS API based on what is available in that version of
the Mac OS.  See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2064.html">Tech Note 2064</a> for more details.</dd>

<dt>RC_RELEASE=Tiger</dt>
<dd>This variable should match the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET:<br>
<pre>
	10.0 = Cheetah
	10.1 = Puma
	10.2 = Jaguar
	10.3 = Panther
	10.4 = Tiger
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>UNAME_RELEASE=8.0</dt>
<dd>This Darwin version number overrides the output of the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/uname.1.html">uname</a> -r command
to match RC_RELEASE:
<pre>
	Cheetah = 1.0 (old release number scheme)
	Puma    = 5.0 (new release number scheme)
	Jaguar  = 6.0
	Panther = 7.0
	Tiger   = 8.0
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>NEXT_ROOT=</dt>
<dd>The 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/LegacyTechnologies/WebObjects/WebObjects_5.1/PostInstall/AboutThisDoc/NEXT_ROOT.html">NEXT_ROOT</a>
variable allows for the finished products to be rooted somewhere other than /.  For Mac OS X,
all projects are installed into /, so this is an empty string.
</dd>

<dt>RC_ARCHS=ppc i386</dt>
<dd>The list of architectures to build.  All Darwin projects are built as 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/universal_binary/">Universal Binaries.</a></dd>

<dt>RC_i386=YES</dt>
<dd>This should be set to YES if i386 is listed in $RC_ARCHS, or empty otherwise.</dd>

<dt>RC_ppc=YES</dt>
<dd>This should be set to YES if ppc is listed in $RC_ARCHS, or empty otherwise.</dd>

<dt>RC_CFLAGS=-pipe -no-cpp-precomp -arch ppc -arch i386</dt>
<dd>Arguments to be passed to the C compiler.  This is a combination of the $RC_NONARCH_CFLAGS variable,
and a -arch flag for each architecture specified in RC_ARCHS.</dd>

<dt>RC_NONARCH_CFLAGS=-pipe -no-cpp-precomp</dt>
<dd>Arguments to be passed to the C compiler, excluding any -arch arguments.</dd>

<dt>UNAME_SYSNAME=Darwin</dt>
<dd>Overrides the output of the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/uname.1.html">uname</a> command.
This should always be set to Darwin.</dd>

<dt>RC_OS=macos</dt>
<dd>Indicates that the project is being built for the Mac OS.  This should always be set to macos.</dd>

<dt>RC_XBS=YES</dt>
<dd>Indicates that the Mac OS X build system is in use.  Apple-specific changes to open source projects
may be conditionalized on this variable.  This should always be set to YES.</dd> 

<dt>RC_JASPER=YES</dt>
<dd>Indicates that the Mac OS X build system is in use.  Apple-specific changes to open source projects
may be conditionalized on this variable.  This should always be set to YES.</dd> 

<dt>RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES=YES</dt>
<dd>Indicates that the linker
(<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ld.1.html">ld</a>)
should print a message for each static archive that is
linked into the final product:
<pre>
[Logging for Build &amp; Integration] Used static archive: <i>filename</i>
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>RC_TRACE_DYLIBS=YES</dt>
<dd>Indicates that the linker
(<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/ld.1.html">ld</a>)
should print a message for each dynamic library that is
linked from the final product:
<pre>
[Logging for Build &amp; Integration] Used dynamic library: <i>filename</i>

<a name="dependencies"></a><h3>Dependencies</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
Many Darwin projects require headers, libraries, and binaries from other Darwin projects.
These cross-dependencies are far too numerous to list here, suffice to say, it's something to
be aware of.  Furthermore, not all of these dependencies are available on a Mac OS X system
by default.  Apple omits many "private" headers files, static libraries, and build tools
from the Mac OS X system.  These tools are availablein the Darwin sources, but those projects
must be built and installed prior to any project that uses them.  For example, compiling 
xnu requires the kextsymboltool binary from the kext_tools project, and the libkld.a static
archive from cctools_ofiles, among others.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="article">
<a name="aliases"></a><h3>Build Aliases</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
Some Darwin projects use the exact same set of sources as another project, but produce
different results based on the arguments passed to the build command.  These projects are known
as build aliases.  Build aliases are used in cases where a single set of source is beneficial
for compatibility.  One example is a client and a server which share a common proprietary
protocol that much be revised on both ends simultaneously.  Another use is to help avoid
a circular dependency between two projects.
</p>
<p>
When building a project that is a build alias, it is important that the RC_ProjectName
environment variable is set to the name of the build alias, not the original sources.
Additionally, many build aliases need an alternate argument than the standard
"install" argument described in the build command.  Since "install" is commonly known as
the target of the makefile, this alternate argument is known as the alternate target.
</p>
<p>When the build tool is a make, the alternate target entirely replaces the "install" argument.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
root# make <b>ofiles_install</b> \
	"SRCROOT=/SourceCache/cctools/cctools-576" \
	"OBJROOT=/private/var/tmp/cctools_ofiles/cctools_ofiles-576.obj~1" \
	"SYMROOT=/private/var/tmp/cctools_ofiles/cctools_ofiles-576.sym~1" \
	"DSTROOT=/private/var/tmp/cctools_ofiles/cctools_ofiles-576.root~1" \
	"RC_ProjectName=cctools_ofiles" \
	"RC_ProjectSourceVersion=576" \
	"RC_ProjectNameAndSourceVersion=cctools_ofiles-576" \
	"RC_ProjectBuildVersion=1" \
	...
</pre>
<p>When the build command is xcodebuild, the alternate target is passed after "install" as "-target <i>alternate</i>".
For example:
</p>
<pre>
root# xcodebuild install <b>-target libmx</b> \
	"SRCROOT=/SourceCache/Libm/Libm-92" \
	"OBJROOT=/private/var/tmp/Libmx/Libmx-92.obj~1" \
	"SYMROOT=/private/var/tmp/Libmx/Libmx-92.sym~1" \
	"DSTROOT=/private/var/tmp/Libmx/Libmx-92.root~1" \
	"RC_ProjectName=Libmx" \
	"RC_ProjectSourceVersion=92" \
	"RC_ProjectNameAndSourceVersion=Libmx-92" \
	"RC_ProjectBuildVersion=1" \
	...
</pre>
<p>Mac OS X 10.4 (Darwin 8.0) contains the following build aliases:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>original project</th><th>build alias</th><th>alternate target</th></tr>
<tr><td>DSNSLPlugins</td><td>DSNSLAppleTalkPlugin</td><td>AppleTalk</td>
<tr><td>DSPasswordServerPlugin</td><td>DSPasswordServerFramework</td><td>PasswordServerFramework</td>
<tr><td>DirectoryService</td><td>DirectoryServiceDaemon</td><td>DirectoryServiceDaemon</td>

<tr><td>Libc</td><td>Libc_profile</td><td><i>none</i></td>
<tr><td>Libc</td><td>Libc_static</td><td><i>none</i></td>
<tr><td>Libm</td><td>Libmx</td><td>libmx</td>
<tr><td>cctools</td><td>cctools_ofiles</td><td>ofiles_install</td>

<tr><td>passwordserver_sasl</td><td>passwordserver_saslkerberos</td><td>KerberosTarget</td>

</table>
</div>
</div>


<div class="article">
<a name="installhdrs"></a><h3>installhdrs</h3>
<div class="articlebody">
<p>
Almost all Darwin projects support an alternate target called "installhdrs".  Building with
this target instead of "install" causes only the header files produced by the project to be
installed into $DSTROOT.  When Apple builds Mac OS X, and "installhdrs" build is performed
on every project that supports it.  The resulting header files are all installed into the
build root before the full build begins.  In this way, most circular dependency issues
related to header files are avoided.
